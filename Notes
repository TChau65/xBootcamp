To launch IDLE (Python's Integrated Development and Learning Environment) on Windows, you have several options, depending on how Python was installed on your system and your version of Windows. Here are the most common methods:

1. Using the Start Menu
For Python Installed from the Python.org Installer:

Click on the Start menu or press the Windows key.
Start typing IDLE.
You should see an application named something like IDLE (Python x.x bit) where x.x is the Python version you have installed. Click on it to open IDLE.
For Python Installed via Microsoft Store:

The process is similar to the above. Just search for IDLE in the Start menu, and you should be able to launch it directly.
2. Using Windows Run Dialog
Press Windows key + R to open the Run dialog.
Type idle and press Enter or click OK. This should open IDLE if your Python installation path is added to the Windows PATH environment variable.
3. Using Command Prompt
Open Command Prompt by typing cmd in the Start menu search and hitting Enter.
In the command prompt window, simply type idle and press Enter. If Python and IDLE are correctly installed and the Python Scripts folder is in your system's PATH, IDLE should launch.
4. Finding the IDLE Shortcut in Python Installation Directory
If you can't launch IDLE using the above methods, you might need to navigate to the Python installation directory and find the IDLE shortcut manually.

Go to the directory where Python is installed (commonly C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX, where XX is the Python version).
Look for a folder named Lib, then idlelib.
Inside idlelib, you should find an executable or shortcut for IDLE, which you can double-click to run.
Note
If these methods do not work, it's possible that IDLE was not installed with Python, or there may be an issue with the installation. In such cases, you might need to reinstall Python, ensuring that you select the option to install IDLE during the installation process.
